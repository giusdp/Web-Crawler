# Web-Crawler
Java Web Crawler.

Made in the summer of 2015.

Asynchronous Java web crawler with a JavaFX GUI. 

IT'S NOT THE FINAL, TESTED, VERSION. So it has various bugs and ugly code.

Made with a team of 3, mainly it downloads web pages with the JavaFX WebKit and runs 
some analysis which are shown in the GUI. It offers various modalities of execution,
and several algorithms to run on the downloaded pages.
It was made as a final project for a university's course.
