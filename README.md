# Web-Crawler
Java Web Crawler.

Asynchronous Java web crawler with a JavaFX GUI. 
IT'S NOT THE FINAL, TESTED, VERSION (which got lost). So it's a bit buggy.
Made with a team of 3, mainly it downloads web pages with the JavaFX WebKit and runs 
some analysis which are shown in the GUI. It offers various modalities of execution,
and several algorithms to run, along with a bunch of data, on the pages.
It was made as a final project for a university's course.
